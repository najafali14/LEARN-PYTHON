Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.



# List
#List are created using large bracket []
#list creation
list1 = [1,2,3,4,'five']
print(list1)
print(list1[2])
// Basic functions:
#insert(): Inserts an element at a specified position.
list1.insert(1,'a')
print(list1)
# append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.
list1.append(6)
print(list1)
#remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
list1.remove(1)
print(list1)
#sort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.
list2 = [2,4,1,7,5,9]
list2.sort()
print(list2)
#reverse(): Reverses the order of elements in the list.
list2.reverse()
print(list2)



#Tuples:
#Tuples are created using parentheses ()
#tuples creation
t1 = ('a','b','c',4)
print(t1)
print(t1[2])



#Set:
#Sets are created using curly braces {}
# set creation
set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
print(set1)
#add(): Adds an element to the set.
set1.add(6)
print(set1)
#remove(): Removes a specified element from the set.
set1.remove(1)
print(set1)



#Dictionaries:
#Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
#Dictionaries are created using curly braces {} and key-value pairs separated by colons :
# dictionary creation
d1 = {'name':'Ali','age':7}
print(d1)
print(d1['name'])
#print only keys
print(d1.keys())
#print only values
print(d1.values())
